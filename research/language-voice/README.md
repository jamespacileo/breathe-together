# Language & Voice Research

Research into the language, voice, and psychological concepts used in meditation and breathing apps.

## Quick Reference

| Document | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| [App Copywriting](./app-copywriting.md) | How Calm, Headspace, etc. write and speak |
| [User Language](./user-language-patterns.md) | How people describe meditation experiences |
| [Connection Concepts](./psychological-concepts.md) | "Part of something bigger" - all perspectives |
| [Phrase Library](./phrase-library.md) | Collected phrases and sentence patterns |

## Key Insights Summary

### 1. Voice & Tone Spectrum

| App | Voice Style | Key Characteristics |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| **Calm** | Warm, nurturing | Soothing, gentle, celebrity voices, "complete mental wellness toolkit" |
| **Headspace** | Friendly, quirky | Playful, accessible, conversational, "meditation made simple" |
| **Waking Up** | Philosophical | Secular-spiritual, contemplative, honest, "spirituality without religion" |
| **Breathwrk** | Action-oriented | Direct, empowering, performance-focused |
| **Insight Timer** | Community-focused | Inclusive, diverse, "part of something" |

### 2. What Resonates With Users

**Language That Works:**
- Simple, clear instructions without jargon
- Invitational rather than commanding tone
- Acknowledging that difficulty is normal
- Phrases that validate the experience

**What Users Say They Want:**
- "Help me feel calm and grounded"
- "Connect me to something bigger"
- "Simple guidance without pressure"
- "Let me feel like I'm not alone"

### 3. The "Part of Something Bigger" Concept

Three valid framings, each powerful:

| Perspective | Language Examples |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Global Sync** | "Right now, across the world...", "Breathing together in this moment" |
| **Community Presence** | "Others here with you", "Breathing alongside X people" |
| **Existential/Spiritual** | "Part of humanity", "Connected to something larger", "Universal rhythm" |

### 4. Secular Spirituality Language

Key phrases that capture transcendence without religion:
- "Connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature"
- "Part of something larger than yourself"
- "A transcendence not above the world, but into the world"
- "Self-transcendence that gives us a feeling of cosmic belonging"

## Recommendations for breathe-together

### Current Voice (Baseline)
The app uses: "Breathe In", "Hold", "Breathe Out", "Join the circle", "{count} breathing together"

**Strengths:**
- Minimal and focused
- "Circle" metaphor is warm and inclusive
- "{count} breathing together" creates presence

### Suggested Enhancements

1. **Add contextual depth**: Consider optional descriptive text that frames the global sync
   - "Right now, people across the world are breathing with you"
   - "Joining the rhythm"

2. **Embrace secular-spiritual language**:
   - "Connected", "together", "shared moment"
   - Avoid religious terms but don't avoid meaning

3. **Balance instruction with invitation**:
   - Current: "Breathe In" (instruction)
   - Alternative: "Breathe in..." (invitation, ellipsis creates flow)

4. **Consider adding onboarding warmth**:
   - Welcome message that sets intention
   - Brief framing of the "together" concept
