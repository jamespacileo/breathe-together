## Relevance to breathe-together

The breathe-together app currently leans toward **Dark/Immersive** style with particle effects. This is a valid approach that creates focus and reduces distractions.

### Recommendations
1. Consider offering light/dark theme toggle
2. Use warm accent colors (teal, orange) against dark
3. Keep UI minimal during breathing
4. Add personality through subtle animations
5. The global/connected aspect is unique - emphasize it

## Design Industry Insights

### What Award-Winning Meditation Apps Get Right

**From UX research and Reddit discussions:**

**Positive Design Elements:**
> "Apps described as simple, clean, and easy to use help users focus on the meditation rather than getting distracted by the app itself"

**Common UI Criticisms:**
- "Some free apps may have a less polished or intuitive design"
- "The UI could be modernised"
- "You're not given a predefined progression of sessions"

### Award-Winning Design Principles

1. **Generous whitespace**: Creates breathing room (pun intended)
2. **Soft, rounded shapes**: Avoids sharp angles that interfere with relaxation
3. **Nature imagery**: Mountains, water, forests create calm associations
4. **Smooth animations**: Transitions should be organic, not jarring
5. **Mobile-first**: Most meditation happens on phones
