## Relevance to breathe-together

The breathe-together app currently leans toward **Dark/Immersive** style with particle effects. This is a valid approach that creates focus and reduces distractions.

### Recommendations
1. Consider offering light/dark theme toggle
2. Use warm accent colors (teal, orange) against dark
3. Keep UI minimal during breathing
4. Add personality through subtle animations
5. The global/connected aspect is unique - emphasize it
