# Xhalr - Breathe Slowly

**Source**: [xhalr.com](https://xhalr.com)
**Type**: Web-based breathing exercise
**Style**: Ultra-minimal

## Overview

Xhalr takes minimalism to the extreme - just a circle and text. No distractions, no background imagery, pure geometric breathing visualization.

## Visual Design

### Breathing Animation
- **Main circle**: Large lavender/purple circle (#9b8db8)
- **Inner ring**: Subtle lighter ring appears during transitions
- **Center**: Small white circle with phase text
- **Expansion**: Circle grows significantly during inhale
- **Contraction**: Circle shrinks during exhale

### Layout
- Full-screen circle, centered
- White background
- Hamburger menu (top-right) for settings
- Nothing else visible during breathing

### Colors
- **Circle**: Soft lavender (#9b8db8)
- **Background**: White (#ffffff)
- **Center circle**: White
- **Text**: Light purple/gray

## Animation

### Phases
1. **Countdown**: Numbers (1, 2, 3...) before phase change
2. **Inhale**: Circle expands, "inhale" text shown
3. **Exhale**: Circle contracts, "exhale" text shown

### Timing
- Smooth, slow transitions
- Clear phase boundaries
- Predictable rhythm

## Technical Notes

- Simple CSS animations
- Very lightweight
- No external dependencies visible
- Settings menu for customization

## Relevance to breathe-together

**Moderately Relevant** - Shows power of simplicity:
- Proves minimal can be effective
- Good contrast to particle-heavy designs
- Clean geometric approach

### Ideas to Consider
1. Countdown before phase changes
2. Visible expansion/contraction scale
3. Option for "minimal mode" in settings
4. Pure geometric shapes without particles
