*Ultra-minimal lavender circle with "inhale" text - demonstrates power of simplicity*

## Overview

Xhalr takes minimalism to the extreme - just a circle and text. No distractions, no background imagery, pure geometric breathing visualization.

## Visual Design

### Breathing Animation
- **Main circle**: Large lavender/purple circle (#9b8db8)
- **Inner ring**: Subtle lighter ring appears during transitions
- **Center**: Small white circle with phase text
- **Expansion**: Circle grows significantly during inhale
- **Contraction**: Circle shrinks during exhale

### Layout
- Full-screen circle, centered
- White background
- Hamburger menu (top-right) for settings
- Nothing else visible during breathing

### Colors
- **Circle**: Soft lavender (#9b8db8)
- **Background**: White (#ffffff)
- **Center circle**: White
- **Text**: Light purple/gray

## Animation

### Phases
1. **Countdown**: Numbers (1, 2, 3...) before phase change
2. **Inhale**: Circle expands, "inhale" text shown
3. **Exhale**: Circle contracts, "exhale" text shown

### Timing
- Smooth, slow transitions
- Clear phase boundaries
- Predictable rhythm

## Technical Notes

- Simple CSS animations
- Very lightweight
- No external dependencies visible
- Settings menu for customization

## Relevance to breathe-together

**Moderately Relevant** - Shows power of simplicity:
- Proves minimal can be effective
- Good contrast to particle-heavy designs
- Clean geometric approach

### Ideas to Consider
1. Countdown before phase changes
2. Visible expansion/contraction scale
3. Option for "minimal mode" in settings
4. Pure geometric shapes without particles

## User Feedback & Design Philosophy

### Minimalism Approach

Xhalr represents an extreme take on breathing app design - proving that less can be more. This ultra-minimal approach has both advocates and critics in the breathing app space.

### Community Sentiment on Minimal Breathing Apps

**Praise for Simplicity:**
> "Simple, clean, and easy to use - helps users focus on the meditation rather than getting distracted by the app itself."

**Design Research Insights:**
From UX studies on breathing apps, users reported that complex scene guidance is "not always easy to follow" and requested "clearer guidance of breath in and out." Minimal approaches like Xhalr address this by removing visual complexity entirely.

**Criticism of Ultra-Minimal Approach:**
- Some users prefer more visual engagement
- Lack of customization options
- No progress tracking or session history

### Key Design Lessons
- **Geometric simplicity works**: A single expanding/contracting circle can effectively guide breathing
- **Color psychology**: Lavender/purple creates calm without complexity
- **Focus over features**: Removing all distractions prioritizes the breathing experience
- **Countdown helps**: Phase transitions with numeric countdown provide clear guidance
